### Relative Strength index (RSI) 

It's famouse for secondary indicator of stock's market. This is presented by **variance** for changing upper and down.

It has tendency if it decrease, it is creasing and  also if it crease, it is decresing.

Recently it should have been not true surely. However, it has been importnat index for advance afterwards. 

### Class code

Anyway, this is presented how to calculate the RSI.

RSI needs variance of upper and down with average of this. And It is calculated

**RSI = Average of Upper / (Average of Upper + Average of Down) * 100**

Caculating **RSI signal** which is calculated moving avereage for RSI, it's comparing with two indexs.

It is simply calculating for start day to today and plot

### Example figure

![image info](images/example_fig_RSI.png)



Typical ticker is AAPL(Apple). This figure is presented at 2021-06-26.

 you just know that this plot what is mean :)



### Model, Selection

For using RSI, we can make model and select ticker in index (Dow, S&P500 etc) ?

I have simple idea to use RSI value of down to up and up to down.

- **It is true that RSI value is under 30?**

In my case, I have choose selected data by Bollinger band's model. This model is explained [this post](https://hanseopark.github.io//2021-06-25-Bollinger-Band/) which is also important finance index.

If you change var of **down** like 30 to 40, you should get many ticker beyond hard condition. 



### Conclusion

Let us know what is RSI and how to caclulate with figure. And then we are going to find ticker using this model :)



 If you want to use this code, I'm very sorry that you should change code and make directory for data a little bit.

 I should appreciate and refer for many blog on google. Thanks a lot.
